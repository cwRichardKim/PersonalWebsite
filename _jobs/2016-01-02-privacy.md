Worked on small features and bug fixes on the [Privacy app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/privacy.com-forget-your-credit/id1040298266?mt=8) (written in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)).  I fell in love with the idea behind [privacy.com](http://privacy.com) and wanted to contribute something before my summer at Google.  I'm now currently working remotely during my last year of college.
