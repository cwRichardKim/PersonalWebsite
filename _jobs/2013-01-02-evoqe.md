Co-founded the “college social life on an app” with 3 friends. Within 6 months we grew to 75% of all iPhone users at Tufts University.  I spent over 4,000 hours writing around 40,000 lines of code that span over 2 iOS apps, a JavaScript backend, and a website.  I also designed the UI / UX of all versions of the app (V1.0 - V3.2) and designed the strategic growth of the product using analytics and periodic feature assessments.
